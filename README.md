# Customer Support Chatbot

## What is this chatbot?

This chatbot is a conversational AI designed to help with customer support queries. It can answer common questions, provide instant responses, and assist with tasks like tracking orders, explaining refund policies, and more. Its primary goal is to improve customer service by automating repetitive queries and offering quick solutions.

## What is the `intents.json` file?

The `intents.json` file is the brain of the chatbot. It contains all the information the chatbot uses to understand and respond to your questions. This file includes:
- **Tags**: Categories for different types of questions, like greetings or order tracking.
- **Patterns**: Examples of what you might ask, like "Where is my order?" or "Hello."
- **Responses**: Answers the chatbot gives, like "Your order is on its way!" or "Hi there! How can I help?"

Think of the `intents.json` file as a guidebook that teaches the chatbot how to handle conversations.

## How to Improve the Chatbot

If you want the chatbot to answer more types of questions or improve its responses:
1. **Edit the `intents.json` file**: Add new questions (patterns) or better answers (responses) to existing tags.
2. **Train and Run the Chatbot**: After making changes, run the chatbot to see how it performs with the updated intents.

Editing the `intents.json` file lets you make the chatbot smarter and more efficient!

## How to Use the Chatbot

Simply ask questions, and the chatbot will provide answers. For example:
- **"Where is my order?"**: Get the latest update on your package.
- **"What is your refund policy?"**: Learn about returning products or requesting a refund.
- **"Hello"**: Start a friendly conversation.

Feel free to experiment and ask different questions to see how the chatbot responds!
